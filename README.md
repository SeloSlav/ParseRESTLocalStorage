# ParseRESTLocalStorage
A REST interface with local storage, using Parse-Server as a remote data source.

![alt text](https://github.com/santafebound/ParseRESTLocalStorage/blob/master/web_hi_res_512.png)

This is a sample application that takes data from a remote web server, i.e. Parse-Server, serializes the data into Java objecsts and then stores them in a local cache.

I will probably turn this into a simple Twitter clone where Users can post status updates and like them.
